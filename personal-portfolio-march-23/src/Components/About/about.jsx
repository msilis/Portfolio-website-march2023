            <h3>Hi, I'm Miks!</h3>
            <p>Originally from Latvia ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡» and raised in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, I am now based in London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ as a frontend developer. While studying classical music (viola) in school, I also taught children to play the violin, developing my skills in communication and patience. I currently have a thriving Suzuki violin studio in North London.</p>
            <p>Throughout my life, I've always enjoyed tinkering and making things. Now, I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to apply my passion for crafting to the world of frontend development. I bring a unique perspective to every project, with a keen eye for detail and a strong ability to problem-solve.</p>
            <p>I'm experienced in various DIY projects and have a solid foundation of knowledge working with different tools such as React (this site is built using React), Node.js, Express.js, Redux, MongoDB and many others.</p>
            <p>I'm committed to working closely with clients to deliver top-quality results. Whether you're in need of a custom website, app, or digital product, I'm excited to collaborate with you and bring your vision to life. Drop me a line!</p>
